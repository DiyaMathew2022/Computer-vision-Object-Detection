# Computer-vision-Object-Detection<br>
Computer Vision Object Detection is the process of detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. This involves applying image processing and computer vision techniques to locate these objects in the image and draw a bounding box around them. Object Detection can be done using various techniques, including Deep Learning-based approaches such as YOLO, R-CNN, and RetinaNet, and traditional computer vision techniques such as HOG and Haar cascades.<br>

# Object Detection using transformers <br>
Object Detection using transformers refers to the application of Transformer models, a type of deep learning architecture, for the task of object detection in images and videos. In recent years, there has been a trend towards using transformers for various computer vision tasks, including object detection. This is due to their ability to efficiently process sequences of features, such as those extracted from image regions, and perform global reasoning through self-attention mechanisms.<br>

One example of using transformers for object detection is DETR (DEtection TRansformer), which replaces the traditional object detection pipeline, including region proposal and classification networks, with a single Transformer network. DETR and similar models learn to predict object categories and locations in an end-to-end manner.<br>

Overall, the use of transformers in object detection offers a promising direction for further improving the accuracy and efficiency of object detection systems.<br>

# DEtection TRansformer (DETR)<br>
DETR (DEtection TRansformer) is a deep learning-based object detection model that uses the Transformer architecture for end-to-end object detection. DETR was introduced in a research paper by Facebook AI Research in 2020. It aims to simplify the object detection pipeline and reduce the dependence on hand-engineered components.<br>

In DETR, a single Transformer network is used to predict object categories and locations in an image. The network takes an image as input and outputs a set of object queries, which are then matched with the corresponding bounding boxes to produce the final detection results. The Transformer architecture enables DETR to perform global reasoning and process information from all regions of an image, making it more robust to changes in scale and aspect ratio.<br>

DETR has shown promising results on several benchmark datasets and has been widely adopted in the computer vision community. It is an interesting direction for further research and improvement of object detection systems.<br>
